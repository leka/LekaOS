# App Tests

App tests are "multi-functional" tests. They allow us to test how modules work together, define robot's behaviors, and improve concrete part of LekaOS.
They may not `assert` anything but can define things to observe.

Examples:

- reinforcers (LEDs + motors + sounds)
- behaviors
- high level scheduling
