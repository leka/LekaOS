## Mbed Client API

This is the Doxygen generated API documentation of Mbed Client. See the [Files](files.html) section to find the documentation about specific API.

The Mbed Client high-level APIs allow Mbed OS developers to create applications with LwM2M features as described in the [Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0-20170208-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0-20170208-A.pdf):

These APIs make it possible to:

- Manage devices.
- Securely communicate with internet services over the industry standard TLS/DTLS.
- Fully control the endpoint and application logic.

The API is written in C++ to allow quick application development.
