# Setup & Installation

## Introduction

LekaOS repository is made to be easy to use:

- simple directory structure
- CMake based with [USCRPL/mbed-cmake](https://github.com/USCRPL/mbed-cmake/)
- Code completion with VSCode + [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
- format with `.clang-format` and `.editorconfig`

## How to install

Before starting, make sure you've read the [mbed documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.1/introduction/index.html).

### 0. Clone the repository

To start with:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leka/LekaOS && cd LekaOS

# Clone or curl Mbed OS using the Makefile
make mbed_clone
# or
make mbed_curl

# With clone_mbed You can specify a branch (default is mbed-os-6.6.0)
make clone_mbed BRANCH=master
```

### 1. Install mbed-cli & co

I recommend the manual install. Make sure to follow the instructions from mbed:

> <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.3/build-tools/install-and-set-up.html>

```bash
# For the latest stable version
python3 -m pip install -U --user mbed-cli mbed-tools
```

Then, install the required tools:

```bash
# First, important packages
python3 -m pip install -U --user pyserial intelhex prettytable

# And finally mbed-cli requirements
python3 -m pip install -U --user -r extern/mbed-os/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install arm-none-eabi-gcc

#### For macOS

```bash
brew tap ArmMbed/homebrew-formulae
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

#### For Windows & Linux

You can download the toolchain here:

> <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads>

## How to use

We put together an handy [`Makefile`](./Makefile) to make it easier to configure and compile your projects.

```bash
# First, you need to clone mbed-os
make mbed_clone

# You can specify a branch (default is mbed-os-6.6.0)
make clone_mbed BRANCH=master

# Then configure the project
make config

# You can also specify a build type (default is Release)
make config BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Finally, to compile your project
make
```

### Using `.mbedignore`

To speed up compilation time, we've setup an [`.mbedignore`](./cmake/templates/Template_MbedOS_mbedignore.txt) file that removes some files from the compilation process.

If you get error about missing headers when compiling, make sure the header's directory is not set in the `.mbedignore` file.

You can edit the `.mbedignore` file here: (it is symlinked to the `mbed-os` directory)

> [`.cmake/templates/Template_MbedOS_mbedignore.txt`](./cmake/templates/Template_MbedOS_mbedignore.txt)

### Mbed CLI & `.mbed`

Using [mbed-cli](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli) is **highly discouraged** as it will be replaced in a near future by new tools from Mbed based on CMake.

If you still want to use it, you can set your target and favorite toolchain in the [`.mbed`](./.mbed) file:

```bash
MBED_OS_DIR=./extern/mbed-os
TARGET=DISCO_F769NI
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
ROOT=.
```

### Flashing the board

## LekaOS, spikes & tests

The main idea behind this template is to have your main source files (those for the big project you're working on) under the [`./src`](./src) directory.

Now, you sometimes need to create a simple, very basic example project to test a new features, investigate a bug or try a different solution to a problem.

These can be added to the [`spikes`](./spikes) directory inside their own directory. You'll need at leat a `main.cpp` and a `CMakeLists.txt`. See [`blinky`](./spikes/blinky) for a working example.
