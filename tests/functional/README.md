# Functional Tests

Functional tests are intended to be run on the robot. They included I/O, BLE, scheduling, etc.

Examples:

- motors
- LEDs
- BLE communication

They are straight forward, as simple as possible and focused on very specific functionalities.

If you need to integrate different modules, refer to [App Tests](../app/README.md).
